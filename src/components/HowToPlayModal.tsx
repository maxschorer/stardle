            <p>The player will either be one of the top 100 players on NBA 2K or an NBA legend.</p>
            
            <p>Each player has five attributes:</p>

              <p><span className="font-bold text-green-600">Green</span> means the attributes match.</p>

              <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
                <li>For seasons and rating, if the value is within 2 of the target player's value, the tile will be yellow.</li>
                <li>For team, the tile will be yellow if target player's team is in the same division as the current guess.</li>
              </ul>

              <p className="font-bold">What about players with multiple positions?</p>
              <p>The player's position will map to their primary one in NBA 2k. For example, if the player's position is PG/SG in 2k, their primary position will be PG. If it's SG/PG, it will be SG.</p>

              <p className="font-bold">How does team work for legends who played on multiple teams?</p>
              <p>It will map to the team where their rating was highest. Ex: Shaq peaked at 98 on the Lakers but 93 on the Magic, so he will be a Laker in the game.</p>
